# Dotfiles storage and installation
## Installing files without git installed ##
You can install my dotfiles with this command:

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/starassassin64/dotfiles/refs/heads/main/script.sh | bash
```

## Script process
The script will download the zip of the repo, unzip it, and link the files with symbolic links.

# What dotfiles are contained
My configurations for LunarVim (lvim), Paru, LazyGit, and my Oh-My-ZSH .zshrc file

# Support?
I will not be providing support for this repo as this is mostly for my own personal use, but is available
to whoever wants to download and install the configurations. If there is any personal identifiable information
please contact me via [starassassin64@starassassin64.com](mailto:starassassin64@starassassin64.com) or create a pull request removing the information. Thanks!!!
